              My programming journey began with my fascination of Minecraft. I became obsessed first with building, but once I discovered the the game had its own built in programming system, I became hooked on coding. I bought a Minecraft server and programmed in a custom scripting language called Skript, which was a lot like Python. Since Minecraft was written in Java, I couldn't wait to learn the language. Over the summer, I watched TheNewBostons Java tutorials, and learned basic Java.
              <br /><br />
              During the next few months I started to become frustrated with my progress, since I did not know how to make exciting programs, until I found The Coding Train's p5.js tutorials by Daniel Shiffman. Not only was Daniel Shiffman educational, he was also fun! I proceeded to binge watch The Coding Train's entire series in a couple of weeks. Daniel Shiffman's love for programming was infectious, as I was now able to create much more interesting, visual games. After concentrating on javascript for a while, I decided to go back to Java, but this time I used the processing library, which is the Java version of p5.js.
              <br /><br />
              During Spring Break, my parents surprised me by taking me to New York to meet Daniel Shiffman. As a professor at NYU, he gave me a tour of the technology department, including his YouTube studio where I have enjoyed watching and learning his tutorials. With a clear passion for coding, this was an incredible experience, to put it lightly.
              <br /><br />
              Eventually, I wanted to make more complex games, with an actual game engine. I watched Brackey's tutorials to learn C#, along with Unity. I participated in multiple game jams on itch.io, which were all awesome experiences. I went back to Javascript to create a Genetic Algorithm. I then programming a Neural Network, which I would translate into Java to teach my computer to play flappy bird. I also learned Python as it is a popular language for machine learning and created a few more AI projects.
              <br /><br />
              Today, I am focused on Competitive Programming using C++. Through websites like CodeForces and Google Kickstart I enjoy solving problems and competing in regular programming contets. While I am still learning, each problem presents a new and exciting challenge that I can hopefully work to solve.

          <p class="descBox">This is a combination of a neural network and genetic algorithm to beat flappy bird.
            This was made in a few days at a programming camp. I copied the NN and GA from my other Javascript
            projects, and translated them into Java. Overall it does pretty well, although other Flappy Bird AI' s can do much better. I'm not completely sure why they are (perhaps they use a much better NN, like tensorflow). This is my overall favorite project as it is the most impressive and combines all of my (Java) knowledge into a single project.</p> <div class="infoBox">
